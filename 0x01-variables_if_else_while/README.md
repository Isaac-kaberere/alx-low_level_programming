0-positive_or_negative.c: 
C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a newline:
Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
 Prints the number followed by is positive if the number is greater than 0, is zero if the number is zero, or is negative if the number is less than 0.
1 . The last digit
C program that prints the last digit of randomly generated number, followed by a new line:
Stores a different value every time the program is run.]
Prints the string Last digit of number is last_digit and is followed by greater than 5 if the digit is greater than 5 if the digit is greater than 5, 0 if the digit is 0, or less than 6 and not o if the digit is less than 6 and 0.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can’t fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.
This program is a simple c program that prints the English alphabet in lowercase. It uses a for loop to iterate through the alphabets from ‘a’ to ‘z’ and uses the ‘putchar()’ function to print each character.

3. alphABET
This is a simple c program that prints the English alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase. It utilizes two for loops to iterate through the alphabets from ‘a’ to ‘z’ and from ‘A’ to ‘Z’. It uses putchar() function to print each character.

4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
This is a c program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters ‘q’ and ‘e’. The program follows the structure of common c program with the main() function as the entry point.
Usage
To run the program, compile it using a C compiler and execute the resulting executable
	gcc 4-print_alphabt.c -o 4-print_alphabt
./4-print_alphabt

5. Numbers
This is a program that prints numbers from 0-9. The program uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 0-9. Inside the loop it converts each number to its corresponding character by adding the ASCII value of ‘0’. The result is then printed on the console using the putchar() function.

6. Numberz
The program will print the numbers from 0-9. The program uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 0-9. Inside the loop, each number is converted to its corresponding character representation by adding the ASCII value of ‘0’ to the remainder of the number divided by 10. This ensure that the program can handle numbers larger than 9 and still print single-digit numbers correctly.
The resulting character is then printed on the console using the putchar() function.

7. Smile in the mirror
This program uses a for loop to iterate through the alphabet in reverse order. Starting from the character ‘z’, it decrements the value of the letter variable until it reaches ‘a’. Inside the loop, the putchar() function is used to output each letter. Finally, a newline character is printed to create a new line after the alphabet.

8. Hexadecimal
This program prints a sequence of digits and lowercase letters in a specific pattern, followed by a new line.
This program uses two for loops to generate the desired sequence. The first loop it iterates over the characters from 0-9 digits and the second loop iterates over the characters from ‘a’ to ‘f’lowercase letters. Inside each loop, the putchar() fucntion is used to output each character. Finally, a newline character is printed to create a new line after the sequence.

9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
The program uses a for loop to iterate from 1-9. Inside the loop, the putchar() function is used to output current number, followed by a comma and a space. Initial number 0 is printed before the loop. Finally, a newline character is printed to create a new line after the sequence.
